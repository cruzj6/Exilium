# Exilium
I'm currently in the very early stages of development. I'm new to Unity so development is a little slow. Currently working on getting basic melee combat to a place where I feel comfortable and like it is polished before I move on to anything else design or implementation wise. 

#Contributing
If you want to contribute let me know. I am fully open to ideas and tips as I am new to Unity and game development in general. Thanks!
